A holiday to Scotland is always amazing thanks to our ScotSpirit - quite simply it is everywhere you go. But this year, we're combining our unique landscapes, enriching culture and famed warm welcome with a celebration of our built heritage, ingenuity and bold designs in the Year of Innovation, Architecture and Design. So, if you're looking for the the mystery of Nessie, fun of a ceilidh and the wonder of the Northern Lights, then Scotland's for you. We would love to share Scotland with you so don't forget to share your experiences with us via ScotSpirit and be in the iKnow in Scotland's Community. Within Scotland, the monarchy of the United Kingdom has continued to use a variety of styles, titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland. The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law.
