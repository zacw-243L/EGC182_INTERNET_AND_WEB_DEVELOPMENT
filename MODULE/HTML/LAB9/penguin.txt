Penguin

Penguins are birds with black and white feathers and a funny waddle. But unlike most birds, penguins are not able to fly -- in the air that is. Penguins spend as much as 75% of their time underwater, searching for food in the ocean. When they are in the water, they dive and flap their wings. It looks just like they are flying! Penguins are shaped like a torpedo. Their body is built for the most efficient swimming with their average speed in the water being about 15 miles per hour. The largest living species is the emperor penguin. On average, adults are about 1.1m tall and weigh 35kg. The smallest penguin species is the little blue penguin, also known as the fairy penguin, which stands around 33cm tall and weighs 1kg.


Scientific Information: Penguins make up the scientific order Sphenisciformes and the family Spheniscidae.
